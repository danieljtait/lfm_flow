Welcome to LFM_Flow's documentation!
====================================

This project uses TensorFlow to implement latent force models in Python. It is
meant only as a short lived project while I familarise myself with TensorFlow
before folding these models into a more general project.

In the interim feel free to browse the user guide to learn more about latent
force models and to fit them using Python.
